  ## 🌙 | Setup
- ## Replit
- You just have to fill up the "config.js" file.
- In the folder "Resolver" folder their is a file named "index.js". Inside of the file at the line no 32. You have to paste your guild/server id
- ## Don't know how to get the server id?
- Click [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-#:~:text=Obtaining%20Server%20IDs%20%2D%20Mobile%20App,name%20and%20select%20Copy%20ID.) to redirect to the Discord support blog.

- ## Aren't using Replit?
- You have to follow the same steps. But make sure you have all of the dependences. You can do it so by doing "npm install"
- Make sure you have the latest ndoeJS version downloaded.

- ## 🧣 | Ordinary Errors
  ### Here are some most common errors you can get while starting the bot.
- Cannot find "xyz" module ->> This error means that you don't have that specific dependency installed.
- Error: Cannot find module 'node:events' ->> If you are getting this error (specially on replit) that means your node version is way too lower to use Discord.js. You can fix this error by upgrading your nodeJS version on replit. You can find more help on [here](https://dev.to/arnavkr/updating-node-js-to-16-in-replit-1ep0).
  ## 📣 | Mandantory things
- Make sure to fill up the config.js file
- Make sure to enable all three ["Privileged Gateway Intents"](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway)
- The MongoDB connection uri isn't mandantory. And also has no use to the bot.
- Also ignore the "prefix" property. Since the bot only supports the SlashCommands/InteractionCommands. So their is no use of the message commands.
